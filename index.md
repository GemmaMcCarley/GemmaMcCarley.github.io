Hi, my name is Gemma and Iâ€™m currently working on the diachrony of null subjects in Latin American Spanish.

Broadly, my research interests fall under sociolinguistics, language contact, the history of English, historical syntax, and corpus linguistics. If you love the intersection of all those things, check out my research group [STARFISH](https://www.ling.uni-konstanz.de/en/walkden/starfish/) ![alt text]([https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png](https://www.ling.uni-konstanz.de/fileadmin/_processed_/3/f/csm_starfish_without_writing_bbd5d3d191.png) "STARFISH logo").

When I'm not researching, I love to travel, cook, knit, and consume as much television as possible.
